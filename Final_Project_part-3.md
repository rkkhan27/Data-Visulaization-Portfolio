[My Data Story on Shorthand](https://preview.shorthand.com/8EauZLXw6EXyakvn)

# Conceiving the Idea:

The whole process of creation of this dataviz story has been an exciting opportunity to apply various techniques that I learnt in this interesting course. It all started with conceiving an idea about what to present. Initially, I thought and researched about differnet topics and searched for data. However, finally, I decided about this topic and presented my idea in the part 1 of this project and after getting feedback, I tried working different aspects of my story by finding more data. 

## Recursion is to Human: 
Initially, the idea of presenting a reality check on American Dream in 21st Century seemed quite abstract; however, I had to recurse several times after consucting user research and subsequently incorporating the user feedback in improving my work. Part 2 of this work was a key step which helped me see my work through eyes of others and interpret it from the point of view of my audiences. Thus, getting invaluable feedback from varied types of users and doing several iterations helped me reshape my work into this final version:

## Learning Continues and Change is Permanent: 
In light of the varied feedback from user research, I made following changes: 

**Improving Chart Titles**
Working on the titles which convey clear ideas to the users was the first step that I took in finalisng my work. I worked not only on the chart titles but also on the presentation titles to make these appealing and communicative of the idea being presented in the chart.

**Use of Colors**
I mulled over the key aspects of my story and came up to the conclusion about the two main aspects of "Innovation" and "Inequality". As both these words have postive and negative connotations reapectively, so I decided to user "Green" color for "Innovation" and "Red" color for "Inequality" throught in the text, titiles, and charts for sake of consistency and making it meaningful for the audience. Also, within each chart, I used same colors to show key trends. I also restricted myself to few colors and hihglighted only the key idea while keeping all other in the background. 

**Choice of Data and Chart**
I also tried finding several data set which would help me connect different dots in my story and thus lead to the final conclusion. After getting the usere feedback, I removed irrelavant charts and tried finding new data for the key aspects of the story. I also changed choice of chart to make it easy to understand for the audience. Removed honeycomb chart I made in Part 2 for mapping the inequality index by state and repalced it with choropleth map.   

**One Idea, One Chart**
I removed unnecessary data from the charts to make these more meaningful. In the income inequality chart, I showd trend only for the top 90th and lower 10th percentiles whilel keeping median in between. Similarly, I improved othere charts as well. 

Finally, I also worked on the outline of my story to make the flow logical. Like, I started with the meaning of "American Dream", how America is living this dream by leading the world through innovation, wehre within the US this innovation is happening, what is happening within those innovation hubs, what future trends are bieng prognosticated if things left unchecked, and what the target audience, which, in this case is the Federal Government should intervene to end this resource convergence.
