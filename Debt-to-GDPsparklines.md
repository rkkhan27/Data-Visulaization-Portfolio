# Treemap Chart 
#### Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio year-on-year Comparison of Different Countries (1995-2019)

This treemap chart shows year on year comparison of the countries on bais of Debt to GDP ratio. In this chart, size of the box illustrates the intensity of the ratio i.e. greater the ratio, bigger the size of the box in the given year and vice versa. Colors are randomly assigned and are not specific to any country. The chart depicts almost 25 years Debt-to-GDP ratio for thirty countries. In each year, the countries have different ratios so it gives better yearly comparison than a consolidated bar chart for a specific year while the year can be selected from  the filter. The chart provides flexibility to compare countries in a specific year and can be used for a detailed yearly analysis. Also, each box gives a pop up message displaying the ratio for the country in the given year.

In the above charts, different methods of visualization have been used to present same data; however, the choice of graph very much depend on the purpose for which that graph is made. The first chart illustrates the latest debt to GDP ratio only for a single country and the comparison is given in bars. However, for each year, one has to use slider given below the chart which also changes the position of the country due to the ratio in that year and the reader has to track the label of the country. There are many country labels on the horizontal axis which might cause issue in looking for a specific country.

The second chart displays trend of tax to GDP ratio for each country while adding each in a side by side lines which broadens the visual analysis and helps in compairing the countries; however, if the reader want to check the debt to GDP ratio for a country in a specific year, this chart tells nothing about that. 

The third chart specifically helps the reader to look for the countries having highest and lowest ratio in a given year while also being able to look for other counties ratio in that year. The drop down filter empowers the reader to select any specific year. It has added granularity and has made comparison easier for the reader. However, it shows no trend over the period of time. 

I have chosen the third type of chart to make it convenient for the user to easily compare countries in terms of debt to GDP ratio on yearly basis. This chart provides more information and felxibility to the reader by making navigation between the years much easier than the first chart.
