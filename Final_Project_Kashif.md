# Project Outline
#### Story: 
I want to compare through my story the innovative startups launched in the US versus the rest of the world from 2006-2022. I further plan to focus on and dig deeper into the US by highlighting the sectors and the geographical areas within the US which are leading the US innovation (through visuals mentioned below). From here onwards, I will reference some research stats regarding the unequal growth patterns evolving out of innovation in the US as it is concentrated to some specific geographical areas/states. Finally, my call to action will be that as people from other areas/states are left with no choice but to shift to the innovation-leading areas/states (leaving their homes and family behind) which is causing inequality in all terms, and there should be some policy to distribute the dividends of progress by establishing new innovation hubs at different locations across the country in accordance with the American Dream.
#### Outline:
1)	Bar chart comparing startups launched in the US vs the rest of the world in last 20 years.
2)	Geographical map showing startups launched in the last 20 years from across the world with graduated points.
3)	Within US, sectoral categorization of companies presented through tree map.
4)	Showing concentration areas by highlighting states housing most of these startups on geographical graduated points map.

# Data Source: 
I will be using data available on Kaggle which enlists around 1000 startups started between 2006-2022 across the globe. Data is presented in different tables and does not contain coordiantes. I will try making my own final table by joining and cleaning it through Python. Mainly, I will use this datatable that can be excessed on (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/empowering-the-next-wave-of-entrepreneurs) and will find other data to substantiate my call to action through further research and all others sources will be referenced. 

# Method and Medium: 
I will use shorthand to present my story. For visulaization, I will use Tableau and Flourish to make charts. My selection of charts will not be limited to what is mentioned above and I will explore more data sources and will analyze my choices of charts in light of the class discussion, and Good Charts book.
