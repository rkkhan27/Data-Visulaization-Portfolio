## Step 1: Selecting the Dataviz:
I have found an interesting visulaisation for crtique.

# Step 2: Critique of Data Visulailzation

The title is clear and simple and just by having a glance of title, one expects a simple pie chart or bar chart giving breakdown of energy consumption by source and sector; however, in first glance one gets confused regarding what the chart is trying to convey because it is very busy. A lot of data is being presented in this viz which is working well - only if one has a lot of time to understand what is being presented here otherwise in first impression one gets confused. The idea of staked bar chart seems working well but the basis of calculation of percentages, putting sector and sources together and adding unnecessary arrows to further add some information have made the overall chart quite difficult to process. Further, the use of colors is random, unnecessary, with no association or utility, and there are too many colors. Further, the staked bars depicting sources and sectors are inconsistent i.e., one moving from low to high and other is different from the first and badly arranged. I will prefer two separate bar charts for sources and sectors along with labels while correctly calculating percentage out of 100 and adding a sixth pie naming it others (2.7%). I will prefer not using too much colors.

Keeping in view the topic and report, the primary audience can broadly be anyone who is interested in knowing about the energy consumption mix of USA. However, it seems that this visualization is prepared only for the researchers working in energy domain as they can spend the time required to unearth what is going on in this dataviz just because too much information is being conveyed through this chart and a common user might just end up avoiding it.  

This method of evaluating the data visualization is effective and almost all the necessary ingredients of good chart design are incorporated in it.  However, it is a little more subjective and have a greater chance of varying from reader to reader. In this method, a general approach to evaluate the data visualization is adopted; however, the Good Charts Method specifically gives a framework to think and plan about the type of visualization that can be used for a specific set of data. For this viz, I will select declarative and data-driven approach to plan for the type of chart needed for this visualization. This viz can be made intuitive just by focusing on one topic at a time, choosing bar chart to give clear comparison of categories, using same color of bars to reduce fight for attention effect and calculating percentages out of 100 while adding another category with name of 'others' so that reader does not get confused between numbers and their percentages.
