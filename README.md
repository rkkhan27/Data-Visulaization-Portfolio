**Telling Stories with Data** at CMU!

## About me
Hi! this is **Kashif Khan** (he, his, him)

I'm a second year Masters student in the MS in Public Policy and Management - Flagship Program at Heinz.
Before coming to Heinz, I was working as civil servant with the Federal Government of Pakistan where I served for 8 years in different capacities and handled multiple policy related issues and public welfare projects. During that time, I developed longing for acquiring quantitative and technology skills for sake of creating greater social good. Previously, I had done MBA in Finance in 2011, which I found insufficient to keep up with my future aspirations of learning modern techniques of efficient management of scarce resources and I decided to challenge myself  by leaving a settled life and my beautiful family back at my country and start all over again in the Grad School to make my drive for knowledge more meaningful. Fortunately, I got Fulbright Scholarship to realize my dream of exploring the nexus of policy and technology cross-section at Heinz and this last one year here has been holistically transformational and exhaustively fulfilling for me. While I am honing my quantitative skills, at the same tiem, I find it fascianting to build proficinency in data visualization tools and techniques in this course. 

## What I hope to learn
I am passionate to learn both tools and techniques to carve engaging visualizations which tell right stories with data.

All of my exicting work is here. Ready to fasciante you.
